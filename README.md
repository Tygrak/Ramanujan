| sigma | Sigma function - the sum of the divisors of a number |
| prime | Returns the nth prime number |
| isprime | Returns 1 if the number is a prime number and 0 if it isn't a prime number |

# More info
Any one character can be used as a variable - but most often x is used anyways. In sum mode n is used as the index of the current term of the sum.
